## asset-management

- Assets will be displayed as cards with each card showing the image and options to edit
and delete. The edit and delete buttons will be visible when a user hovers over the card.
- When the user clicks on the delete button, a confirmation dialog should be displayed.
Only on confirming, the theme should be deleted.
